<h3 id="sprint-review">Sprint Review</h3>

<h4 id="what-went-well">What went well?</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Since this was my first sprint, I don’t feel too strongly that I did anything that well.  Creating a daily routine of creating a new Google Doc to write down notes and tasks did help me stay organized and motivated each day, although it made searching for previous notes a little less convenient (more on that later).</li>
  <li>I did an alright job of realizing I had trouble focusing from home at my desk, and trying to head outside to cafes for a change of environemnt which actually helped me regain focus.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="what-didnt-go-well">What didn’t go well?</h4>

<ol>
  <li>I found it difficult to self-motivate and stay focused for longer periods of time.  After completing a small milestone or portion of work, I found it all too easy to take a break or seek a distraction.  I also found it especially difficult to simply stay home and work at my home desk, since it’s not a dedicated place for ONLY work.<br />
I felt also felt reluctant from a lifestyle of only working from my desk at home, and constantly decided to leave my apartment for air or a change of environment.  Coming back from breaks, I found it difficult to also manage and prepare meals and cleaning up afterwards.<br />
A possible solution is to purchase or create a work timer and decide on set intervals at which I should stay focused for.  (Maybe 2 hour working periods with an hour break in between.)</li>
  <li>Apart from my lack of focus, I believe I also misjudged the amount of work required to do everything listed on my sprint agenda.  As an excuse though, I still believe the work I set out to do was doable had I been at least more attentive and focused.  BUT, if I’m working with new technologies and I’m doing assignments I have no experience doing yet, I should allow myself a bit more time to do more research and figure out the proper and efficient way of handling tasks.  For example, I wasn’t prepared for the amount of research I need to do before writing out the document, and even then I’m still doing additional research as I’m still writing the document.</li>
  <li>I gave up on tasks I didn’t feel ready or prepared to do yet, maybe because I was still too worried about the next few tasks I needed to do?  Specifically worried about the wireframing, I’m not quite sure why I stopped short of completing them.  It was either because I felt too lazy to go through every page?  Did I feel it was unnecessary?  Or maybe it’s because I still didn’t know enough about the project to finish creating the wireframes.  Arguably, creating well designed and aesthetic websites is a skill I don’t have enough experience in.</li>
  <li>I’m constantly rehashing and rethinking things I’ve already done.  I’m not sure if I’m just double checking everything is fine, or if I’m doing things to feel productive.  I should consider creating a consolidated page of notes rather than restricting everything to daily notes and referencing only when I need it.<br />
At the end of each day, I definitely should just rehash or copy and paste everything I’ve finalized or done into one singular document.  I should make it a point to not have to reference and sift around daily notes for information, and rather just that one single page resource.  Let’s call tentatively call it a cheat sheet.  Before segueing too far, rehashing things is fine as long as I’m at least learning or figuring out something new from it.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="what-to-do-next-time">What to do next time?</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Actually block out and dedicate a set time and amount of time to ONLY do work.  Considering making a personal work clock or log the hours I spend being busy and doing work.</li>
  <li>Actually block out facebook and other distracting websites when trying to focus on work.</li>
  <li>I need to be able to switch tasks when I feel like I’m getting blocked for other certain tasks.  It might be too mentally straining to work on the same task for too long periods of time.</li>
  <li>Create and maintain a consolidated page of notes rather than creating a new document of notes for each day.</li>
</ol>
